The project is learn-to-code application with tutorials and exercises to bridge the gap of boring hard code to easy, fun way of learning the basics of programming and some ruby language. I have worked on the prototype for the site to test out the concepts and lesson on actual students ages 10+ doing a beta program.

A resume consultation company to help individuals with their resumes and tips on landing a long comming career. This is an all in one tool to manage applications and inputs and display the data in a graphic interface for analysis purposes. Also within the app, workers can use the site for client management and be able to take notes and pass them along in the business processes. I built out the whole application from backend to frontend, worked hand and hand with the client to create the dream site and tools they would need to run the company. This project really expanded my horizons of implementing multiple third party APIs, such as Braintree for payment and processing, Recharts for graphs and analytic data, and making my own API to fit the client needs. This site is in the process of getting revamp into a new version and technologies.",
